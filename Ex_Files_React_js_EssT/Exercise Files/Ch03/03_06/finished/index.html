          // In an earlier video, we saw how it was important to wrap any sibling components inside of div because
          // we saw that error saying that adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tech. So we're seeing how
          // React only wants to render that single component but we're seeing here how adding a div if we're constantly adding wrappers 
          // to the page this can start to junk up our elementary. We're seeing there's a div here with root and then another div. And then we 
          // start to get to the actual components that are on the page. Now, something to keep in mind is that instead of using a div, you can use
          // what's called a React Fragment. We can add this by using React.Fragment. We can see that our div root is wrapping directly around the header,
          // this section in the footer that we've created with these components. It's also possible to use an even shorter syntax for this but we have
          // to make sure that we're using specific versions of React. So for now, we're going to keep React.Fragment but later I'll show you how to
          // remove React.Fragment and just use this really shorthand syntax. But for now, just know that React.Fragment will not add anything to
          // the DOM but it will allow you to render these sibling components with ease
