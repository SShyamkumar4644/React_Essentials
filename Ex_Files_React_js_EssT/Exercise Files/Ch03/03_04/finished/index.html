                // We're still using dishes, but now what we want to do is this,
                // we'll say dish.title, we'll remove this key here, and then we'll
                // say dish.id. So you might be thinking, isn't this the same, 
                // because we're just using an index again? Not really, because 
                // the data is actually stable. We've created it using this 
                // function instead of being created while the list items are 
                // being rendered. Another thing to think about is that your
                // data already might look like this, so you could just use an ID or 
                // another unique field if you are already dealing with an array of objects. 
                // Keys help keep your data in sync as your application state changes over time,
                // so this is why it's really important to add them anytime you're trying to 
                // iterate over something and return a dynamic value.

          id: i,
          title: dish
        })
      );// So something we could do is perform a little data transformation, 
      // which we'll do here on line 53. So we're going to go ahead and create an 
      // array of objects. So we'll call this Dish Objects, and we'll set that equal 
      // to dishes.map for each item in our dishes array. We want to create an object,
      // and the reason for that is because each one of these should have an ID. 
      // So we'll say ID is i, and then the title is dish, so whatever the value of this 
      // dish is. Now, something to point out here is that whenever we 
      // are returning an object from an arrow function, we need to point that 
      // arrow function at a set of parentheses, instead of just pointing it directly at these curly braces. So let's give it a save, this should create these objects. We're going to see though, that nothing much changes, because we need to add dish objects as our value for dishes.
