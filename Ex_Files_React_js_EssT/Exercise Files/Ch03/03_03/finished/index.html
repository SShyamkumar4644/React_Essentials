<!--So far we've passed properties into components in a few different 
  ways. We've used strings like Cindy and amazing. 
We used this little date function. We also saw how we used a number, 
you could pass true or false. All of these are going to be past 
via these JSX expressions. Only strings are going to be wrapped in quotes. 
But what happens if we have a different data type? Something a little bit 
more complex, 
like an array? Well, let's go ahead and create an array and try it out. 
So, first things first, we're going to, on line 46 here, create a list of 
dishes at our restaurant. 
So we could add Black Bean Soup. We could add Macaroni and Cheese and 
then we could add Salmon and Potatoes. Perfect. Remember, this is your 
restaurant, so obviously put your 
own favorite foods on your own list. Don't let me tell you how to run 
your restaurant here. Now, if we wanted to display this list inside of 
our main component, we would need 
to map over it. So, let's go ahead and collapse our footer here. And 
then we're going to inside of this section, let's go ahead and replace 
our paragraph with an unordered list. 
We're going to say that this UL should inside of this, we're going to 
map over the dishes. So we'll say dishes.map. Then for each dish, we 
want to return a list item. And this 
list item should look like this. In it we should add a dish. So let's 
see what we get. At the moment, dishes is just referencing this global 
variable called const dishes. 
So we can still render all of these values. Now, I actually want to 
access these values via props though, right? So it's going to, it's 
going to be up to me to pass these 
dishes in this way. So we'll say dishes=dishes. Now this property, 
we can reference off of props.dishes and we should see the same output.
 So this is working as we expect. 
Hiding inside of our console here, we have a warning. So it says each 
child in a list should have a unique key property. So in the next video, 
we're going to fix this.
