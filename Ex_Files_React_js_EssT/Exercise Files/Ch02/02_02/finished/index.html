<!--So, what I want to do is I actually want to create this as a variable heading. So instead of having all of these functions inside of another function,
let's go ahead and cut this whole part here and paste it. And then what we'll do here on line 24 is we'll add heading variable and this should work the same way.
Now let's change this Getting Started with React.
We'll add a couple exclamation marks. Keep us honest to make sure that this is working. And it is. 
So this has allowed us to create a React element using its own separate variable.
