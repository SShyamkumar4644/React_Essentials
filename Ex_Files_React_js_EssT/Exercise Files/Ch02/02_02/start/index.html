<!--Right now, we're using the ReactDOM.render function to take this createElement
call that we've added here on line 19 and add it to the document at the element
called root. So we're saying, find that element on the page and then inject our 
React code into it. Anytime we're writing code with React, we want to think about
these elements as being these little bits of UI that we can render at any moment.-->
