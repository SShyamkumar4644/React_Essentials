<!--As you work with react and JSX together, you'll start to notice how powerful 
JSX actually is. We can use it to inject dynamic content into our tags simply by 
referencing them by variable name. So what do I mean by that? Let me show you. 
The first thing I'll do is I'm going to create a variable called robot and I'm going 
to set this equal to our robot here. Then I'm going to create another one for a 
cowboy and we want to make sure that those are always being passed in strings. 
And then we'll grab the moon as well. So let moon equal our nice little smiling 
moon friend. So inside of our list now, I want to take whatever this value is and 
I want to display it inside of our list item. So we'll go ahead and use the curly 
braces. Anytime we're using a curly brace in JSX, we're using a JSX expression. So 
here we'll pass robot, cowboy, and moon. So now nothing has really changed about our 
output. So let's add another list item here. And what I want to add is we'll say, 
let name equal react. We're going to plug in the name here and we should see react 
being added to our list items. Now, remember anytime you see a JSX expression with 
the curly braces, you can use all sorts of functions inside of these braces. So 
let's say, I said toUpperCase, and we called that function. And now this is going 
to transform react into all caps. Similarly, we could say name.length. That'll give 
us the property that we've asked for. So JSX is a really powerful way that we can 
inject dynamic content into our apps.
