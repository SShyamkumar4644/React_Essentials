<!--Notes
Inside of our index.html file we have in our head tag of this document,
a couple different script tags. So I took the first step here of adding some
links to the CDN of react. CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. Think of this link as being a way to quickly add the react library to your page in the browser. If you highlight this and you copy and paste it into Chrome, you'll notice that this is giving you the entire react library. So we're just going to reference this when we're writing our code.
So we have here react which is everything we need to get started with react.
And then we also have react-dom. So react-dom is everything we need to actually add this react to the page. Think of this link as being a quick way to add the react library to your page and the browser so that all of the functions and features you might need from react are preloaded.
Once you add this to the page you can start to create your first element using react. 

The way that react works is that instead of creating these elements on the HTML page, using HTML we're going to instead create them using react, using JavaScript. So what I'll do is here in the body I'm going to create a div, and this div will have an ID of root. More often than not when you're working on a react project,
the place where we're going to add our react code is to a div that has this ID.
