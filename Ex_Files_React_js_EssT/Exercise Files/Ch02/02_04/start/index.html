<!--A quick thing to mention as we're working with these HTML files is 
anytime you are trying to swap between different files, you can do this up in 
your search bar here and you can replace 0203 with 0204. So now, even though we 
are at our new video here, we're in our new file, we're still seeing this unexpected 
token error. So the reason that we're seeing this is because JSX this tag-based 
syntax is not supported in the browser. So what we actually have to do here is we 
have to take this code and I'm going to copy this for the sake of demo, we need to 
use some sort of tool as a compiler. Now, if you go to babeljs.io and you click on 
try it out, this will be an interface that you can use to take some code that you've
written. You can see what it looks like after Babel has been used. So we're seeing 
that our unordered list with all these different list items is generating all of 
these create element calls. When we use a tool like Babel, it's going to take this 
code that's not supported by the browser and turn it into code that is so that we 
don't have to write all of this code that is hard to read, it's sort of hard to 
write, there's a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong. Instead, we're going 
to write it like this using this awesome tag-based syntax. And all of this 
compilation will happen so that it works in the browser
