<!--The fastest way to get started with this is to use another one of these CDN 
Links. And I'm going to add this here. If you want to grab the link, you can 
always grab it from the finished file. But we're going to find this at 
unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js. .min just means that it's 
been minified for the browser so that it will work a little bit more quickly. 
And then the other thing that we need to do, we're still noticing if I refresh this 
that we have that syntax error, the thing we need to do to fix this is instead of 
using text javascript, we need to use text/babel. Babel is going to go through any 
of the script tags that have text Babel and it's going to transform any of these 
tags that don't work in the browser to those create element calls that do. Something
we're seeing here in our console is that it says you're using the in browser Babel 
transformer. Be sure to compile your scripts for production. So this is not the most 
optimized way of working with Babel, but it's going to get us started quickly by 
just using this to transform this in the browser. Later in the course we'll be using
other tools that are going to handle all of this before the code even gets to the 
browser. So that's Babel, in addition to being used for JSX, it's also used for the 
most modern JavaScript syntax so that we don't have to wait to use these awesome 
new features-->
