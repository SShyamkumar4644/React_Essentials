<!--and I'm going to replace the ul here to make this work, 
we're going to just use tags. So this looks a whole lot like 
HTML. We're going to go ahead and create a little emoji list 
here, how about that? So we'll say Control + Command + space. 
We will select a robot. That's one. We'll add another list 
item. Control + Command + space. Cowboy. We'll say moon. How 
about that smiley moon? Perfect. So now we're doing the exact 
same thing that we did here but this time with tags. Now, the 
only problem with this is if I try to run this, we're going 
to see that there's an unexpected token. As soon as we hit 
this line 20 where we're asking React to render a JSX tag, 
we see a problem. In the next video, we're going to fix this 
problem using Babble.
