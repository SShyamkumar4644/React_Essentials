<!--The first thing I want to do here is 
change our heading to an unordered list. So we're
going to make this a ul, a bullet list, and now how would 
I add different child elements like list items to this? Well
, all I need to do for this third argument that we send to 
React.createElement. Remember, this is what we want to create.
This is any properties that we want to send. So for example,
I could say like style, color, blue. And then this should 
make it that color. Let's add our child elements first. 
We'll say list item, null and Monday here. And now we should
see this style has been applied number one, so our 
properties have been injected so we also have this 
createElement called creating a list item. What is a list 
if it only has one item? We can add to it, Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday and now we have all of these being rendered. As our
user interface becomes more complex, as we have more createElement 
calls on the page, our code starts to get a little hectic. And by that 
I just mean that every single element that I would need to create has 
to have its own createElement call. So what we want is some sort of a 
helper, some sort of a syntax to come fix this for us and that helper 
is called JSX. JSX or JavaScript as XML is an HTML-like syntax for 
creating UI elements. So instead of having to use all of these createElement 
calls, and I'm going to replace the ul here to make this work, 
we're going to just use tags.
